# 🚀 EXACT STEPS TO DEPLOY TO VERCEL

## The Root Cause

Your Next.js app is in `web-dashboard/` subdirectory. Vercel needs to know this!

---

## ✅ SOLUTION: Follow These Exact Steps

### Step 1: Go to Vercel Dashboard

1. Open [https://vercel.com/new](https://vercel.com/new)
2. Log in with your GitHub account

### Step 2: Import Your Repository

1. Click **"Import Git Repository"**
2. Find and select: `Smart-Library-Management-and-Monitoring-System-using-ESP32`
3. Click **"Import"**

### Step 3: ⚠️ CRITICAL - Configure Root Directory

You'll see the configuration screen. This is the MOST IMPORTANT step:

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────┐
│ Configure Project                       │
├─────────────────────────────────────────┤
│                                         │
│ Framework Preset: Next.js ✓             │
│                                         │
│ Root Directory: ./        [Edit] ←─────┼── CLICK "Edit"!
│                                         │
└─────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

**ACTION REQUIRED:**

1. Click **"Edit"** button next to "Root Directory"
2. You'll see a text field
3. Type: `web-dashboard`
4. Press Enter or click outside

It should now show:
```
Root Directory: web-dashboard ✓
```

### Step 4: Build Settings (Auto-Detected)

These should be automatically detected:
- **Build Command**: `npm run build` ✓
- **Output Directory**: `.next` ✓
- **Install Command**: `npm install` ✓

Leave these as-is!

### Step 5: Add Environment Variables

Click **"Environment Variables"** section and add these **7 variables**:

```
Name: NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_API_KEY
Value: AIzaSyCI0gN-FwbTzfS43_LURWjHAr_JfwDaglM

Name: NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_AUTH_DOMAIN
Value: smart-library-using-esp32.firebaseapp.com

Name: NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_DATABASE_URL
Value: https://smart-library-using-esp32-default-rtdb.asia-southeast1.firebasedatabase.app

Name: NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID
Value: smart-library-using-esp32

Name: NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_STORAGE_BUCKET
Value: smart-library-using-esp32.appspot.com

Name: NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_MESSAGING_SENDER_ID
Value: (get from your Firebase console)

Name: NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_APP_ID
Value: (get from your Firebase console)
```

**For each variable:**
- Click "Add"
- Enter the Name
- Enter the Value
- Click checkboxes for: Production, Preview, Development
- Repeat for all 7 variables

### Step 6: Deploy!

1. Click the big **"Deploy"** button
2. Wait 2-3 minutes
3. ✅ Done!

---

## ✅ Verification

After deployment:

1. You'll see: **"Congratulations! Your project has been deployed"**
2. Click **"Visit"** to see your dashboard
3. Check that:
   - ✅ Dashboard loads
   - ✅ No 404 errors
   - ✅ Firebase data displays
   - ✅ All pages work

---

## 🔧 If Deployment Fails

### Error: "No package.json found"

**Cause**: Root Directory not set correctly

**Fix**:
1. Go to Project Settings
2. General → Root Directory
3. Set to: `web-dashboard`
4. Save
5. Go to Deployments tab
6. Click "Redeploy" on latest deployment

### Error: "Build failed"

**Check**:
1. Go to deployment logs
2. Read the error message
3. Most likely missing environment variables

**Fix**:
1. Go to Project Settings
2. Environment Variables
3. Add all 7 variables listed above
4. Redeploy

### Error: Firebase not connecting

**Fix**:
1. Double-check all environment variables are correct
2. Make sure they start with `NEXT_PUBLIC_`
3. Verify Firebase Database URL is correct
4. Check Firebase Console → Database → Rules
