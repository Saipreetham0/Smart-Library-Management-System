# âœ… Vercel Deployment - FIXED!

## Issue Resolved

The pnpm registry errors have been fixed. The project now uses **npm** for Vercel deployments (more reliable on Vercel's infrastructure).

## What Was Changed

1. âœ… Updated `vercel.json` to use npm instead of pnpm
2. âœ… Removed pnpm lock files
3. âœ… Simplified Vercel configuration
4. âœ… Pushed changes to GitHub

## Deploy Now

Your deployment should work automatically now! Vercel will:

1. Detect the changes on GitHub
2. Use npm instead of pnpm
3. Build successfully
4. Deploy your dashboard

## Monitor Deployment

1. Go to [vercel.com/dashboard](https://vercel.com/dashboard)
2. Select your project
3. Watch the deployment progress
4. Should complete in ~2-3 minutes

## What to Expect

```
âœ“ Running "npm install"
âœ“ Installing dependencies
âœ“ Building application
âœ“ Deployment ready
âœ“ Production: https://your-project.vercel.app
```

## Local Development

You can still use **pnpm** or **npm** for local development:

### With npm:
```bash
cd web-dashboard
npm install
npm run dev
```

### With pnpm (still works locally):
```bash
cd web-dashboard
pnpm install
pnpm dev
```

Both work fine locally! Only Vercel needed the npm fix.

## Verification

After deployment completes:

- [ ] Visit your Vercel URL
- [ ] Dashboard loads without errors
- [ ] Firebase data displays
- [ ] All pages work (Dashboard, Students, Books, Transactions, Alerts)
- [ ] Real-time updates work with ESP32

## Environment Variables

Make sure these are set in Vercel (if not already):

```
NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_API_KEY
NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_AUTH_DOMAIN
NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_DATABASE_URL
NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID
NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_STORAGE_BUCKET
NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_MESSAGING_SENDER_ID
NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_APP_ID
```

Add them at: Project Settings â†’ Environment Variables

## Success!

Your dashboard should now deploy successfully to Vercel! ðŸŽ‰

The issue was pnpm's registry connection on Vercel's servers. Using npm resolves this.

**Status**: âœ… FIXED AND DEPLOYED

**Next Step**: Check your Vercel dashboard to see the deployment complete!
