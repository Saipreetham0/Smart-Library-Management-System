## Why pnpm?

- **Faster** - Up to 2x faster than npm
- **Efficient** - Saves disk space by using hard links
- **Reliable** - Strict dependency resolution

## First Time Setup?

If this is your first time running the dashboard:

1. Make sure you have the `.env.local` file with Firebase credentials
2. If not, copy `.env.example` to `.env.local`:
   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env.local
   ```

## ESP32 Connected?

Make sure your ESP32 is:
- âœ… Powered on
- âœ… Connected to WiFi
- âœ… Writing to Firebase

You should see real-time updates in the dashboard as you scan cards!
